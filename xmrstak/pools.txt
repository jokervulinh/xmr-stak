 * pool_address    - Pool address should be entered as "pool_address:port" (e.g "pool.ryo-currency.com:4444"). Only stratum pools are supported.
 * wallet_address  - Your wallet, or pool login.
 * rig_id          - Rig identifier for pool-side statistics (needs pool support).
 * pool_password   - Can be empty in most cases or "x".
 * use_nicehash    - Limit the nonce to 3 bytes as required by nicehash.
 * use_tls         - This option will make us connect using Transport Layer Security.
 * tls_fingerprint - Server's SHA256 fingerprint. If this string is non-empty then we will check the server's cert against it.
 * pool_weight     - Pool weight is a number telling the miner how important the pool is. Miner will mine mostly at the pool
 *                   with the highest weight, unless the pool fails. Weight must be an integer larger than 0.
